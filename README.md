# 1R

1R is a simple classification learning algorithm that develops a set of rules from a single input attribute (hence "1" for the number of inputs and "R" for "rules"). The algorithm works by looking at an attribute of a given data set and producing a rule based on that attribute to predict the outcome. This process is repeated for each attribute to create a complete rule set.
